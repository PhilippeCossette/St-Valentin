        <h3>Dear Gabrielle,</h3>
        <p>
          From the moment I met you, my life changed for the better. You fill my
          life with joy and love, and I still can't comprehend what is
          happening. I'm in disbelief.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I made this to ask if you would like to be my Valentine. Even
          though I think we share the same feelings for each other, who knows? I
          thought I'd ask to confirm.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope you say "YES" because it already cost me a kidney to join you
          in Asia. I can't believe I'm doing this. This will definitely be the
          craziest Valentine's Day of my life, and I have not an ounce of
          regret. I love you so much! Yes or no, I'll still ask again next year.
          I promise. See you soon.
        </p>
        <span>Your husband.</span>
